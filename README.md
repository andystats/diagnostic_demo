# Understanding Diagnostic Tests: A Bayesian Approach

Open the live demo on GitHub Pages: https://andystats.github.io/diagnostic_demo/

Note: This repo also serves as a quick test/demonstration of GitHub Pages’ ability to host fully client‑side, interactive pages (Tailwind, D3, KaTeX) from a single HTML file.

## What It Is

An interactive teaching aid for Bayesian reasoning using diagnostic tests, inspired by Gerd Gigerenzer’s natural‑frequency approach in "Calculated Risks."

## What You Can Do

- Page 1: Core concepts and notation (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity; PPV/NPV)
- Page 2: Interactive explorer with sliders, theater of 1000 dots, scaled Venn diagram
- Page 3: Worked example using natural frequencies
- Page 4: Bayesian methods appendix with sequential updating

## Tech Notes

- Single‑page app: `index.html` with CDN‑loaded Tailwind, D3, and KaTeX
- No backend or build steps required

## Run Locally (optional)

- Open `index.html` in any modern browser

## Credit

- Grounded in work by Gerd Gigerenzer and research on effective risk communication
